### Brief Introduction

A stroke is damage to the brain, which is harmful to our health. In our to explore the reason to cause the stroke, We analyze stroke condition on a dataset containing 5110 observations with 12 attributes. Our Objective is to provide a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. To be clear, we examine all of data from it and determine which factors lead to higher risk of stroke. The following is performed on the data:

* Univariate Analysis
* Bivariate Analysis
* Correlation Analysis

### Building Requirements

Our program requires an environment of Python 3.0+. Following main third-party libraries are used: 

* Pandas 0.23.4+ 

`pip install pandas==0.23.4`

* Seaborn 0.9.0+

`pip install seaborn==0.9.0`

* Matplotlib 2.2.3+

`pip install matplotlib==2.2.3`

* Numpy 1.15.1+

`pip install numpy==1.15.1`

Our dataset are directly downloaded from Kaggle: Stroke Prediction Dataset.

If you've already built up the environment containg all the required third-party libraries, simply run main.py in the EDA directory to get the output described and shown in the notebook.

### File structure

* data: the directory containing the original .csv data file

* notebook: the directory containing the jupyter notebook

* EDA: the directory containing the .py files realated to exploratory data analysis
