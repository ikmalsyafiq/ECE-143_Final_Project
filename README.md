# ECE143-Stroke Risk Analysis

### Brief Introduction
A stroke is damage to the brain, which is harmful to our health. In our to explore the reason to cause the stroke, We analyze stroke condition on a dataset containing 5110 observations with 12 attributes. Our Objective is to provide a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. To be clear, we examine all of data from it and determine which factors lead to higher risk of stroke. The following is performed on the data:

* Univariate Analysis
* Bivariate Analysis
* Correlation Analysis
